            <h1 class="text-center">
              Here is how I became a
              <div>front-end developer</div>
            </h1>
            <div class="content-about">
              The first computer I saw was a big old Schneider which looked like a multi-story stereo. It must have been 1983/1984 or around that time and it must have been almost as big as me. My father was and still is a complete tech nerd and so my brother and I grew up with computer technology from a very early age. Our favourity one was a Sharp with a plotter (which was later also offered as plotter for the C64 - just fyi). I can still hear it rambling whenever it was 'printing' out our favourite 'image': a racing car üèé. I can't remember how many of these prints we had, but it must have been lots and lots of them.</div>
              <div class="content-about">
              We were the first in our friendship group, in our classes, in our schools to have a computer, a laptop, not because we had money, but because our father rather did not go on holiday to foreign shores, but put his money where he said was the future - I guess he was right. Nobody understood him back then. I have to tell you, my father is a vicar - not the typical job to be crazy about computers, I know, but he is also a very scientific person, which maybe makes it a bit more plausible.</div>
              <div class="content-about">
              We children didn't really care if we went to Spain or whereever or not. We loved the computers, were enraptured by them. I remember my brother opening the old ones up to look what was inside and how they worked and taking them apart and me, well I was more interested in how the programs ran. How I could make things on the screen change. My first own computer was a C64 and the next one a C128. Suddenly I did not have to write by hand anymore, it was so much faster. I could write down stories which were 100 pages long or more in days... It was perfect! I still have some floopies lying around with all my works from childhood and teenage years somewhere. Not that anyone would like to read them. üòÜ</div>
              <div class="content-about">
              Then Tim Berners-Lee opened the internet for everone and Microsoft Office came along. I started to work as a foreign language correspondent and translator. I remember us running around the office with disks from one computer to the other because there were no networks at that time. Only one computer in the library had internet access and could send emails. Crazy times. I was kind of a computer doctor. Whenever someone had problems with their documents, I was asked for help. Everything was still new for many of my colleagues who had worked with typewriters all their life and had just only started using computers.
            </div>
            <div class="content-about">I still often ask myself why I never went to uni and read IT or went into the IT business, but I guess I was kind of satisfied with the way it was. I was always involved with IT. In one company I helped building the network and then was maintaining the server, in the next, I was the contact and go to person for everything IT in Germany, as the main office was in the USA and Germany did not have an 'official' IT department. Then there was this company which had an IT department, but everyone came to me, because it was faster and then I was an IT trainer. And this was all besides doing my regular job.</div>
            <div class="content-about">I think it was just the next step to learn how to code as this was what was missing. As I am just a really nosy person and am always looking for new things to learn, I was caught hook, line and sinker five minutes into

              <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/free-class" target="_blank" title="SheCodes free, 60-minutes coding session for beginners" class="content-links">free coding session</a>. No way around it. I had to learn how to code. And now, here I am: eager for each new lesson and already dreading that the last one may come to soon. However, I guess, with coding, there will always be something to learn. Although, one thing I know... I will miss Matt's entertaining and well presented lessons and the challenges at their end. Thank you, SheCodes, for this incredible experience! Chapeau!</div>
